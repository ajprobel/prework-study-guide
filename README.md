# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This is a web application that was developed to help students who want to learn some of the fundamentals of web development.
Learning the fundamentals of web development can be a daunting task, and I hope this web application can help organize some information for people to digest.
As I went through the prework assignments for the UNC programming bootcamp, I took notes about the different topics covered. I applied these notes in practice to build the web application.

There are 4 sections on this web application: HTML; CSS; Git; JavaScript.
Each section contains an overview of general notes about the topic.
Open the DevTools console by right-clicking and selecting "Inspect", or entering `ctrl`+`shift`+`i` on a Windows machine (for Mac, use `cmd`+`opt`+`i`)
Inside the DevTools console, each topic that was covered in the prework assignment is listed. 
Following this, a random topic is generated to help the user choose which topic to start with!
