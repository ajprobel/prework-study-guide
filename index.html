          <h2>HTML</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language"</li>
            <li>Semantic HTML Elements describe what the content and role of the element itself</li>
            <li>Contents within any html element must be contained between an opening tag and an ending tag</li>
            <li>While "element" and "tag" are used interchangeably, "element" refers to the entire element from the opening to the closing tag. A tag refers what's inside the angle brackets</li>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
            <li>The section element defines a section in a document that contains thematic content</li>

          <h2>CSS</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>Inline CSS utilizes styling an element directly in the HTML file</li>
            <li>Internal Style Sheets contain CSS rules for the webpage in the head section</li>
            <li>External Style Sheets (the most popular) allow developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file</li>
            <li>Each CSS rule must have a selector, a property, and a value. A property plus a value is known as a declaration</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
            <li>If you're using an external style sheet, you must link it in your HTML code</li>
            <li>Class Selectors allow you to give certain styling attributes to specific elements</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>JavaScript features variables, operators, conditionals, functions, and events.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Different data types can be stored in variables, such as numbers, strings, arrays, and boolean values.</li>
          <li>Multiple values can be stored in a variable by using an array.</li>          
          <li>JavaScript can be referenced as "JS"</li>
          <li>JS is case sensitive.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>We can utilize conditional statements to interrupt or direct the control flow in JS. The most common conditional statement is the `if` statement.</li>
          <li>Each item in an array has a unique indentifier for its location; this is called an index. Indices start with 0!</li>
